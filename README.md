# Future adds
- Create appropriate automatic stylisation of html tables
	- currently I copy and pasted a powerpoint table. oops.
- Check out settings for image preview
	- currently there's duplicate display in the AY2021 pic. suspect due to default thumbnail settings. (to edit)
- Proper positioning of logos
- Automated website building based on user-push/edit of content
	- see how to do and implement
- Fine editorial process illustrated to users
	- (linked to previous point)
	- edit push process so that each new text file in the 'project' folder will automatically initiate a webpage that can be selected from a newly created drop down menu on top.
